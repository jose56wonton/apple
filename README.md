This is my 4th HTML/CSS project. It is a clone of  [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/) version
of Apple's website.

The purpose of this project was to use what I have recently been learning about
Gradients and Positioning.

This project is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) HTML/CSS track.
The project itself can be seen [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients)!
